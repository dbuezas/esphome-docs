      - Images/screenshots/example configs of this device being used in action.

The ``bl0942`` sensor platform allows you to use BL0942 energy monitors sensors with
ESPHome. These are used in some Tuya-devices (e.g. AUBESS Tuya WiFi MiNi Smart Switch With Energy Monitor)

The communication with this integration is done over a :ref:`UART bus <uart>`.
You must therefore have a ``uart:`` entry in your configuration with both the TX and RX pins set
to some pins on your board and the baud rate set to 4800 with 1 stop bit.

    # Example configuration entry
    uart:
      id: uart_bus
      tx_pin: TX
      rx_pin: RX
      baud_rate: 4800
      stop_bits: 1

    sensor:
      - platform: bl0942
        uart_id: uart_bus
        voltage:
          name: 'BL0942 Voltage'
        current:
          name: 'BL0942 Current'
        power:
          name: 'BL0942 Power'
          filters:
            multiply: -1
        energy:

        update_interval: 60s

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **voltage** (*Optional*): The voltage value of the sensor in Volts.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **current** (*Optional*): The current value of the sensor in Amperes. All options from
  :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **power** (*Optional*): The (active) power value of the sensor in Watts. All options from
  :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`. (*Note: Some power meters will report this in negative values. It may be that they have something wired backwards. Use a filter to multiply it by -1. *)
- **energy** (*Optional*): Use the voltage value of the sensor in kWh.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **frequency** (*Optional*): The frequency value of the sensor in Hertz. All options from
  :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
  All options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
- **update_interval** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): The interval to check the
  sensor. Defaults to ``60s``.
- **uart_id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID of the :ref:`UART Component <uart>` if you want
  to use multiple UART buses.
